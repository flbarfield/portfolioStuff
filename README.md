<h2>Summary</h2>
Portfolio site including links to my projects and ways to get in contact with me.

---

<h2>Optimizations</h2>

 1. A blog section.
 2. More projects! And as I obtain more projects, I'll have them displayed in a way the eye can see more at once on desktop.

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
I think when you build your first portfolio, it really solidifies a moment of, "Oh, okay, I'm doing this. For real. And people can see me doing this in public. This is a thing now, and I'm going to have to live with it." <br><br>

And so far, I'm happy I took the leap!
